# Basics
Mk48.io is a multiplayer naval combat game. You start off a small ship, and consume crates to increase your score (to level up your ship). While a small amount of crates spawn naturally, sinking other ships directly increases your score and spawns many more collectibles.

# Movement
There are four ways to move your ship:
1. **Left click and hold**
2. **Right click** and optionally hold (this is the recommended way to move)
3. **Tap and hold** (on touch screen)
4. Use the **WASD** or **arrow keys** to move, and 'x' key to stop

Once your ship is moving in a direction, it will keep moving, so you can focus on using your weapons.

If using mouse controls, your ship will turn to point towards your mouse. You can control the speed of your ship by varying the distance between your mouse and your ship.

# Ships
Just like in real life, there are many different types of ships, each with different advantages:

1. **Motor-torpedo boats** occupy the lower levels and generally carry multiple torpedoes and possibly guns.
2. **Corvettes** and **Destroyers** are larger and carry more weapons, including slightly more powerful guns.
3. **Cruisers** are a compromise between destroyers and battleships.
4. **Battleships** and **Dreadnoughts** are very formidable ships, having extremely powerful main cannons. They may carry a minimal complement of aircraft for submarine defense.
5. **Submarines** travel underwater, making them immune to certain types of weapons, but must surface to fire certain types of weapons.
6. **Hovercraft** can travel on land and water.
7. **Rams** are specially designed to ram other ships.
8. **Dredgers** have the ability to modify the land. New land can be created by clicking in front of them, and old land can be destroyed by sailing over it.
9. **Icebreakers** can plow through ice and snow without taking damage.
10. **Minelayers** dispense magnetic mines that can help guard a small area.
11. **Aircraft carriers** command a squadron of aircraft which follow your mouse cursor to attack enemy ships!

Once you earn enough points, you can pick an **upgrade** from the top-middle of the screen. Be careful when upgrading, as becoming a larger ship may lead to crashing into land or reduced mobility if the water is too shallow.

Enemies are more likely to detect larger ships. However, a few ships have a property known as **stealth** to help you evade detection.

Here is a full list of ships: [Mk48.io Ships](/ships/).

# Weapons
There are multiple different types of weapons available on various ships. In general, weapons are fired by clicking in the appropriate direction (although the Space or 'e' keys can also be used).

1. **Torpedoes** are powerful underwater weapons. Some torpedoes have the ability to track targets automatically, with sonar.
2. **Missiles** are airborne and are faster, but less maneuverable than torpedoes.
3. **Rockets** are like missiles but lack guidance.
4. **Rocket torpedoes** deploy a torpedo when in the vicinity of an enemy submarine.
5. **SAMs** (surface-to-air missiles) can shoot down aircraft and missiles.
6. **Gun turrets** shoot very fast shells that do moderate damage.
7. **Depth charges** are stationary weapons that can be deployed against pursuing ships or submerged submarines.
8. **Mines** are like depth charges but last much longer and are more damaging.
9. **Aircraft** fly towards your mouse cursor, and automatically deploy weapons of their own.
10. **Depositor** creates new land. We'll let you figure out if this can be used as a weapon.

Once fired, all weapons take some time to **reload**. Each type of weapon and each turret reload independently. Consuming crates speeds up reloading.

# Sensors
All ships have some combination of sensors to identify other ships and obstacles:
1. **Visual** tracks all targets, with a range that depends on conditions.
2. **Radar** tracks targets above water.
3. **Sonar** tracks underwater targets.

There are two modes for sensors, **active** and **passive**. Passive mode listens for emissions (e.g. sound in the case of sonar) from other entities. Active mode emits a signal and resolves contacts based on the signals that bounce back. In general, active mode allows you to see more, but has the potential to give away your position. You can toggle between the modes with the 'z' key.

If a contact is on the border of your sensor range, it will appear as an arrow. In this case, you know something is there, but not what it is.

# Fleets
You can join other players to form a fleet, using the panel in the top left corner of the screen. As the creator of a fleet, you can accept or deny those who request to join it. Members of a fleet cannot hurt each other with weapons. Fleets have a limited capacity, depending on the number of players online.

# The Arctic
Experienced players may attempt to explore the Arctic biome, located far North. It is important to understand that Arctic has three separate types of terrain, snow, ice sheet, and cracked ice sheet. Snow, which appears white and smooth, will damage any ship upon contact. The two types of ice sheet will slow and damage most ships, the difference being that non-icebreakers cannot destroy non-cracked ice sheet. Submarines can travel beneath both types of ice sheet.
